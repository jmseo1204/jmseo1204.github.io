Hi, I'm Jungmin Seo, an undergraduate student from South Korea.

Mathematical analysis is one of my strengths, and handling visible objects has always been intriguing to me.

Therefore, Computer Vision is my most interesting research field, especially 3D reconstruction, Diffusion, and SLAM. My motivation comes from the moments when I feel that what I am making might be the first trial in the world.

To refresh myself, I enjoy lifting weights, writing my own novels, and consuming any type of media based on Science Fiction. I love almost every kind of physical activity, except for ball games :(

Also, my daily life, including my productivity, wholly counts on music: R&B/soul and Bossa nova for chilling, and house and high-BPM orchestral game music for focusing.

I welcome any kind of meeting, including a coffee chat, so feel free to contact me if you are interested!
